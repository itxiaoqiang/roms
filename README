This is a branch of the ROMS code kept at myroms.org
(https://www.myroms.org/), containing sea ice and several other changes
people have contributed, notably the CoSiNE and COBALT ecosystem models,
a floats-like fish model and some ice shelf fixes. You are strongly
encouraged to register with myroms.org for access to the forum where
this code is discussed.

Some files were modified to use the intel OneAPI Compiler.
Linux-ifort.mk were change from mpif90 to mpiifort. After that
we can also use the Intel® Trace Analyzer and Collector and Intel® 
VTune™ Profiler to get a better performance
